            <p class="animated fadeInUp delay-07s">Engineering Graduates will be able to:

                   <br> 1. Engineering knowledge: 
                    Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.
                    <br>2. Problem analysis: 
                    Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.
                    <br> Design/development of solutions: 
                    Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
                   <br> 4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: 
                    Use research-based knowledge and research methods, including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.
                   <br> 5. Modern tool usage: 
                    Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling of complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.
                    <br>6. The engineer and society: 
                    Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.
                    <br>7. Environment and Sustainability: 
                    Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions to societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.
